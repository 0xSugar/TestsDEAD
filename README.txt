Here're some tests I do while learning Java. Always happens that JavaRush don't give enaugh informaion and I need to search from other resourses for more information. And of course to remeber it I need at least a litlle bit practice. 

And some of them are in this "Test" project. There are other that I created separately in other projects.. it's just for studying.

Started to learn Java on 19.02.2020.
